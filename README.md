This is a slightly modified version of Menyoo mostly for me learning more C++ and testing with this.

I may add some chaos mod features from other mods, and more in the future, not sure what I'll do with this yet.

I might also try to add the Enhanced vehicles from the Enhanced version if I can get this mod working: [Enhanced Content for Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/1267)
